## CSS in JS (JSS) + React Hooks
The goal of building this repo is to illustrate my understanding of JSS ([JSS GitHub](https://github.com/cssinjs) - [JSS Website](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.4.0)). I will do this by completing the following list of tasks I created:
- clone my webpack repo & setup this repo.
- install JSS.
- convert the existing boilerplate layout.scss structure to completely use JSS.
- duplicate layout.js & convert to functional component to allow React Hooks use.
- comply with react-jss to use JSS with react hooks. 
- leave detailed commits to ensure readability.

##### this repo was generated off my webpack in-depth repo which can be [found here](https://github.com/Maxnelson997/WebpackBabelReact-InDepth).
