## CSS in JS -- JSS
The goal of building this repo is to illustrate my understanding of CSS in JS. I will do this by completing the following list of tasks I created:
- clone my webpack repo & setup this repo.
- install JSS.
- convert the existing boilerplate layout.scss structure to completely use JSS.
- leave detailed commits to ensure readability.

##### this repo was generated off my webpack in-depth repo which can be [found here](https://github.com/Maxnelson997/WebpackBabelReact-InDepth).
##### See [My Website](https://www.maxnelson.io) For More Development Related Content.
